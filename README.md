## Description 
It's been a while since I've posted any code here, focused entirely on my work. Let's go without ado I'm seeing a lot of devs using and talking well about nestjs a framework for developing rest apis using nodejs, and not only for rest apis it also offers several ready-made templates for microservices and graphQL, in addition to native support for typescript, so I decided to create my first rest api using this framework, I have implemented some features in my work using nestjs, we created a BFF a service to meet the demands that one of our consumers needs, which is the app. I confess that I'm really enjoying this framework I'm going to create some and sink a little deeper into this framework.
